# Companies hiring for space
This repo is meant to be a list of companies that hire security people for Space Based Companies that are out of this world!

## Motivation

As someone in this space I always hear how can I get into space as a security engineer, satellite  engineer, IT, etc. Here is a curated list of companies to look at.
This is also similair to something I've previously helped on. https://github.com/jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote 
## Contributing
You can help that list by creating issues or creating merge requests.

## Quality Gate

Some companies promote remote talents, some other don't but are not against it, companies are okay to be listed if one or the other is true (listing a source is prefered!)

Remote is meant to allow people from anywhere (or at least anywhere in a given timezone) without being forced to be in an office on a daily base.
