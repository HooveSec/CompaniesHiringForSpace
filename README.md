# Companies hiring for space
This repo is meant to be a list of Space Based Companies that are out of this world!

## Motivation
As someone in this space I always hear how can I get into space as a security engineer, satellite  engineer, IT, etc. Here is a curated list of companies to look at.
This is also similair to something I've previously helped on. https://github.com/jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote 
## Contributing
You can help that list by creating issues or creating merge requests.

## Project Goals 
- Get the list together with company, their mission, locations and link to careers page. Potential crowd-sourcing for data checking 
- Find a better way to organize it (Do we want to do A-Z, By Location, or By mission type?
- Decide if this needs to be a website that can maybe filter easier
