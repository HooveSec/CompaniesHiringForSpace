# Companies hiring for space :star: :sparkles: :dizzy: :star2: 
This repo is meant to be a list of Space Based Companies that are out of this world!

## Motivation :penguin:
As someone in this space I always hear how can I get into space as a security engineer, satellite  engineer, IT, etc. Here is a curated list of companies to look at.
This template is also basically ripped from something I've previously helped on (Thanks Alexander) . https://github.com/jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote https://x.com/alexanderjaeger 
## Contributing üíØüî•
You can help that list by creating issues or creating merge requests with new compaines, filling in ones that haven't been fully development, or adding any amplyfying information. Thanks! 

## Project Goals :bug:
- Get the list together with company, their mission, locations and link to careers page. Potential crowd-sourcing for data checking 
- Find a better way to organize it (Do we want to do A-Z, By Location, or By mission type?
- Decide if this needs to be a website that can maybe filter easier
- Figure out how to abc this by code
- ~Add a section for intern~ 
## FAQ ‚ùî
Q: Company X is not listed, can we add it?
A: Sure, either make a pull request or raise an issue or tell me via twitter (@HooveSec)
